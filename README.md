# Matrix-Vector-Multiplication-Benchmark

In this repository, I will provide results regarding the implementations of matrix multiplication, vector multiplication and also matrix vector multiplication.

# Run

In order to run the program for main_test.c, you will need to do the following command:

```
make
```

After make has been typed in the terminal, type the next command

```
./main.out
```

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity Benchmark

## Time Complexity

After running the code below, it will describe the amount of time it takes for a computer to run this specific algorithm


In your terminal you will need to type the command below

```
make
```

after make has been typed, type the next command below;

```
./maketesttime.out
```

I have stored the data of my time complexity using a .dat file which turns the result into a format which is usable to be implmented into a graph. After ./maketesttime.out is done, follow the command below

```
./time.dat
```
the command above will return the results into a format suitable for a graph implementation.

## Space Complexity

In order for you to be able to run the space complexity, use the command below:

```
make
```
./mainspace.out
```
After the code has been run for specific matrix sizes, the memory usage can be checked via the task the manager.

here are my results:

![Space N = 1000](Images/image.png)

![Space N = 1000](images/image(1).png)

![Space N = 1000](images/image(2).png)

![Space N = 1000](images/image(3).png)

![Space N = 1000](images/image(4).png)
